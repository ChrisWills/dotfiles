* Features to add
** quick funtion for editing dot-file - steal from spacemacs
** add gtags 
   be careful since some keybinding in the spacemacs setup broke org mode
** Look into autoformatting tools for elisp
** add work stuff in a non-ip exposing way
** fancy mode line (maybe)
   Might just need a couple additions since I'm starting to like the basic mode line
** consider git/hg integration mode
** ocaml stuff for home
   
* Bugs
** counsel/ivy buffers get resized weirdly when an extra long line is in the output
   Consider trying to get counsel-rg to work with helm so we can drop ivy or make ivy nicer
